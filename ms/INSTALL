This directory is for building GNU diffutils on PC operating systems.
It currently assumes GCC with either DJGPP or emx.

To build, check `pc/LIB/Makefile' (particularly its definitions for
`prefix' and `exec_prefix') and then do the following:

	cd ..
	make -f pc/LIB/Makefile OS-TARGET

where

	LIB is either `djgpp' or `emx'.
	OS is either `dos' or `os2'.
	TARGET is either `debug' or `release'.

If you change pc/djgpp/Makefile, check your changes by running
`make -f pc/Makefile.add check-makefile ENV=djgpp'; likewise for emx.

The makefiles have the minimal changes from `../Makefile'
and may therefore contain targets that may not apply on your hosts.
